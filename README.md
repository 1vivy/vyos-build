VyOS toplevel build
===================

For historical reasons, VyOS uses branch other than master as default branch.
We know it's confusing and it's against any accepted practice, but this is the way it is,
at least until nextgen VyOS is ready.

The branch that contains the most recent development version is called 'current'. Please refer to it
isntead of the master branch.
